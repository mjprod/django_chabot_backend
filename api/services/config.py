Task:

Given a conversation between a user and an agent in JSON format

Analyze the entire conversation transcript to identify user messages and corresponding agent responses. Follow these rules:

***Instruction Rules***

CORE RULES:

- Identify Agent Messages: Messages where IsService == true indicate they are from the agent.
- Use Corrected Responses: If an agent's message has AdminAction == 1 or AdminAction == 2, retrieve the corrected response only from the AdminReply.
- Extract User Questions: Summarize possible user questions based on AdminReply and user messages in the whole conversation context.
- Structure in Q&A Format: Present the extracted user questions and their matched agent responses in a clear Q&A format, ensuring each user message is accurately paired with the correct agent response.
- Maintain Accuracy: The agent's response must remain unchanged in the final output, and do not change the original language it is using
- Assign each Q&A a category id based on \n{json.dumps(category, indent=2)}\n, and a subcategory id based on \n{json.dumps(subcategory, indent=2)}\n. 
- Make sure the subcategory must belong to the assigned category. Category and subcategory should only be assigned with a number! You need to find a number, it is compulsory!
- Assign each Q&A a language id: 1=English, 2=Malaysian, 3=Chinese. You MUST assign an id to the language field.

Return a list of question-answer pairs in the exact following format. Do not use markdown formatting (` ```json `). Just return the raw JSON object.:

[
    {{
        "question": "<User's message>",
        "answer": "<Agent's response>",
        "category": "<Category's ID>",
        "subcategory": "<Subcategory's ID>",
        "language": "<language's ID>"
    }}
]
